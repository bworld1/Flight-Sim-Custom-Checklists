# Flight-Sim-Custom-Checklists
My custom checklists for FSX and P3D in html format ready to be added to the aircraft folder.
Rename the original checklist html file in the aircraft folder, if there is one, then add the custom checklist file.
Then, after saving out a copy of the aircraft.cfg file, edit the aircraft.cfg using any program like notepad, etc.. You want to add the checklist filename (minus the extension) to the correct location, it will be obvious.
